# From CUDA to Chromosomes: Sequencing a Genome with a GPU-Accelerated Docker Stack

In our [previous guide](https://github.com/data-tomic/cuda-ubuntu-setup-guide), we laid the groundwork: we configured an Ubuntu machine with the latest NVIDIA drivers, Docker, and the NVIDIA Container Toolkit. We built the engine.

Now, let's take it for a drive.

In this post, we're going to do something that just a few years ago would have required a dedicated HPC cluster and days of computation: **we'll analyze a human chromosome to identify genetic variants and pinpoint a clinically significant mutation.** And we'll do it in minutes.

This is a practical demonstration of how a properly configured GPU stack can revolutionize bioinformatics and personalized medicine.

## The Goal: Finding the Needle in the Haystack

When a person's genome is sequenced, we get a massive data file. Our goal is to compare this data to a reference "human genome" to find all the differences, or **variants**. These variants are what make us unique, but some can also be linked to diseases.

Our workflow will be:
1.  **Variant Calling:** Use the GPU-accelerated NVIDIA Parabricks to find all 130,000+ variants on Chromosome 20.
2.  **Annotation:** Use SnpEff to translate these raw variants into meaningful biological information (e.g., "this variant changes a protein in gene X").
3.  **Clinical Search:** Filter millions of data points to find a single, clinically relevant mutation in a gene associated with a pediatric immune disorder.

## Prerequisites

1.  A system configured according to the [previous guide](https://github.com/data-tomic/cuda-ubuntu-setup-guide).
2.  Sample data: We are using a public dataset from the individual NA12878. You will need:
    *   The reference genome (`ucsc_hg19.fa`).
    *   The sequenced data file (`BGISEQ_PE100_NA12878.sorted.chr20.bam`).
    *   These should be placed in a workspace directory, e.g., `~/parabricks_workspace/input_data`.

## Step 1: The Heavy Lifting - GPU-Accelerated Variant Calling

First, we'll run the core analysis using the `pbrun deepvariant` command inside a Docker container. This tool is optimized to use NVIDIA's Tensor Cores for incredible speed.

**The Command:**
```bash
# Define our workspace directories
export INPUT_DATA_DIR="${HOME}/parabricks_workspace/input_data"
export OUTPUT_DATA_DIR="${HOME}/parabricks_workspace/output_data"
export TEMP_DIR="${HOME}/parabricks_workspace/temp_data"

# Run the Parabricks container
# This mounts our data and gives the container access to the GPU
docker run --rm --gpus all --ipc=host \
  -v "${INPUT_DATA_DIR}":/input_data:ro \
  -v "${OUTPUT_DATA_DIR}":/output_data:rw \
  -v "${TEMP_DIR}":/tmp_data:rw \
  harbor.k8s.dgoi.ru/deepvariant/clara-parabricks:4.5.0-1 \
  pbrun deepvariant \
    --ref /input_data/ucsc_hg19.fa \
    --in-bam /input_data/BGISEQ_PE100_NA12878.sorted.chr20.bam \
    --out-variants /output_data/chr20_parabricks_output.vcf \
    --num-gpus 1 \
    -L "chr20" \
    --tmp-dir /tmp_data
```

**The Result:**
You will see the Parabricks log scroll by, ending with this incredible summary:
```[PB Info 2025-Jul-01 13:18:09] ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[PB Info 2025-Jul-01 13:18:09] ||        Program:                                       deepvariant        ||
[PB Info 2025-Jul-01 13:18:09] ||        Total Time:                                     39 seconds        ||
[PB Info 2025-Jul-01 13:18:09] ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

> **Takeaway:** A process that would take over 12 hours on a traditional CPU-based server was completed in **39 seconds**. This is the power of GPU acceleration.

## Step 2: Assessing the Output

The analysis generated a Variant Call Format (VCF) file. Let's see how many variants we found.

**The Command:**
```bash
grep -v "^#" ~/parabricks_workspace/output_data/chr20_parabricks_output.vcf | wc -l
```

**The Result:**
```
132642
```
We have over 132,000 variants on a single chromosome. Manually analyzing this is impossible. We need to enrich this data.

## Step 3: Preparing for Interpretation with Conda and SnpEff

To make sense of our data, we need a powerful annotation tool. **SnpEff** is a standard in the field. We'll install it safely using **Conda**, a package manager for scientific software.

**The Commands:**
```bash
# 1. Install Miniconda (if you haven't already)
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -b -p $HOME/miniconda
source ~/miniconda/bin/activate
conda init

# (Re-open your terminal for changes to take effect)

# 2. Create a dedicated environment and install SnpEff
conda create -n snpeff_env -c bioconda snpEff -y
conda activate snpeff_env

# 3. Download the hg19 genome database for SnpEff
# This might take 10-15 minutes, it's a large file!
snpEff download hg19
```
Now we have the tools to turn our raw data into biological knowledge.

## Step 4: Annotation - Turning Data into Knowledge

We'll now run SnpEff on our VCF file. It will add an `ANN` field to each variant, describing its effect (e.g., does it change a protein? which gene is it in?).

**The Command:**
```bash
# Navigate to our output directory
cd ~/parabricks_workspace/output_data

# Run SnpEff
snpEff hg19 chr20_parabricks_output.vcf > chr20_parabricks_annotated.vcf
```
The command will run quickly and create a new, annotated VCF file.

## Step 5: The "Aha!" Moment - The Clinical Search

This is where it all comes together.

**Scenario:** Our patient has symptoms of a rare pediatric immune disorder. We know that the gene **DNMT3B** on Chromosome 20 is linked to ICF syndrome (Immunodeficiency, Centromeric instability, Facial anomalies). Can we find a damaging mutation in this gene?

**The Command:**
We'll search our annotated file for variants that are both:
1.  Predicted to have a `MODERATE` impact (e.g., changing an amino acid).
2.  Located within the `DNMT3B` gene.

```bash
grep "|MODERATE|" chr20_parabricks_annotated.vcf | grep "DNMT3B"
```

**The Result:**
```
chr20   31922246  .  C  T  .  PASS  ANN=T|missense_variant|MODERATE|DNMT3B|DNMT3B|transcript|NM_006892.3|protein_coding|4/22|c.1708C>T|p.Arg570Cys|...```

**This is our "needle in the haystack."**

Let's break it down:
*   `missense_variant`: The mutation changes an amino acid in the protein.
*   `MODERATE`: It's predicted to have a functional effect.
*   `DNMT3B`: It's in our target gene.
*   `p.Arg570Cys`: Specifically, it changes the protein's 570th amino acid from Arginine to Cysteine.

## The Big Picture

In less than 20 minutes, we went from raw sequencing data to a specific, clinically relevant hypothesis. This workflow, running on a single machine, demonstrates the transformative potential of in-house, GPU-accelerated genomics:

*   **For Doctors:** Get actionable results in hours, not weeks.
*   **For Patients:** A faster path to diagnosis and personalized treatment.
*   **For Researchers:** The power to analyze massive datasets and make new discoveries.

We've successfully built a powerful genomics workstation. The next step is to apply it to real-world challenges in oncology, immunology, and rare diseases.
